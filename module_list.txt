MODULES

Sense (space)
These modules work as the inputs for the system:

    Sensor
        Plug in sensor (5V), if needed translate from ananlog value to digital
    Camera
        detects body in image and trigger
	tech: pi+picam+opencv 
    Pulse
        generate signal in regular interval
        settings: set interval

Transform (signal)
These modules can be placed in-between the system:

    Delay
        waits until signal is sent forward
        setting: delay time
        	
    Ramp
        incremental increase from 0 to signal voltage (3.3/5/?), ramp time, sustain time
        setting: ramp time, sustain time

    Split
        one-to-many
        settings: none
        power: no

    Logic
        and, or, not
        settings: switch select logic mode, button for "not"Boolean

    Toggle
        signal changes the state of the module, the output is the current state (2 in, 2 out)

    If...else
        3 inputs: 1 for state control, 2 for data flow, 1 output
	
    Counter/Adder
        counts signal triggers up to set limit
        setting: count limit 

    Random
	set the number of options 

    Smooth
	smooths out the irregularities in analog input
	> can we implement this as optional functionality into sensor mod?

    Multi
	Multipurpose mod with various in-built functionalies, user selects the functionality from interface
	

    Matrix
	Module that can do multiple things at the same time	
    

    Supervised
	Supervised ML module, Train with selected combination of outputs, Play the trained model, Reset training
	

Play (output)
These modules can be used as outputs the system:

    Video
        video player on raspi with 2 modes: loop / video playback on trigger
        settings: switch
    Sound
        sound loop / video playback on trigger
    Slideshow
	set of images displayed in alphabetic order, change image on trigger signal
    DC Switch
        on/off relay, eg for lights, electronics
    AC Switch
        on/off relay, eg for lights, electronics
        connectors: CEE 7/4 Schuko, IEC C13 KOJELIITIN NAARAS (https://www.partco.fi/fi/saehkoetarvikkeet/iec-liittimet/9154-ac-r-jatko.html)
        referance: https://www.verkkokauppa.com/fi/product/244850/Fuj-tech-Aviosys-9255-GE-etaohjattava-IP-pistorasia
    Motor
        run motor in selected direction and speed
        settings: direction, speed
        input: direction (bool), speed (int)

Transmit (to elsewhere)
These modules are also sort of outputs the system:

    IR
        sends IR signal, record the signal by pressing button, playback when trigger signal received
        settings: button to record ir signal
        https://github.com/bartoszadamczyk/pico-ir
    OSC
	send message as osc over network
	https://github.com/SpotlightKid/micropython-osc	

    IOT
        sent trigger signal to cloud

Convert
These modules create link to other system:

    Wifi/LAN
        converts the signal to message and sends 0 or 1 to udp/osc

    Midi?
        eg. signal to note
        https://github.com/cjbarnes18/micropython-midi
    DMX?
        what's the output? where to use it? how to make it?
